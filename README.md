### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Alfian
I am an experienced iOS programmer with 7 years of expertise in developing high-quality applications. My skills encompass a wide range of programming paradigms, including functional, declarative, and reactive programming, utilizing frameworks and libraries such as RxSwift, Combine, UIKit, and SwiftUI. I am currently expanding my knowledge by learning Android development with Kotlin and exploring cross-platform solutions like Flutter and React Native. In addition to my professional work, I am passionate about personal projects, one of which is creating a design system for SwiftUI called [Anastasia](https://github.com/alfian0/Anastasia). This project aims to simplify and streamline the design process for developers by providing a comprehensive and easily customizable library of styles and components.
